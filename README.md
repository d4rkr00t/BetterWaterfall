# Waterfall Extension for Chrome

My version of native network tab in chrome devtools.

It shows sizes of resources like height of bar.
And you can see detail view of each resources and figure out where are you spend page load time.

## Installation

You can checkout project and build it by:

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp build
```

And install it as a unpacked extension.

Or download a **better-waterfall.crx** and install it manualy.
